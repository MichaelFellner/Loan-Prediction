<h1>Overview</h1>
This project's aim is to predict whether home loans from 2007 were approved or not using a dataset. This project is primarily a proof-of-ability project and is unlikely to have any immediate practical import in 2020. This project showcases the following abilities:
<ul>
  <li>Data Analysis</li>
  <li>Data Cleaning</li>
  <li>Feature engineering</li>
  <li>Machine Learning (Logistic Regression & Random Forests)</li>
  <li>Deep Learning </li>
</ul>
<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Numpy</li>
  <li>Pandas</li>
  <li>Matplotlib</li>
  <li>Sci-kit Learn</li>
  <li>Keras</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes: </h3>
 Dataset once available from lendingclub.com. Since taken down, but can be extracted from sources such as https://data.world/jaypeedevlin/lending-club-loan-data-2007-11
<h1>Future Plans</h1>
<p>As of now, while the data is cleaned, a decent predictive model has yet to be created. One of the challenges of creating a better model is the unbalanced nature of the dataset. While the target to be predicted is a matter of binary classification, there are far more misses than hits. Having a model that can account for the highly uneven distribution in the target column has been difficult to construct. I hope to consult with other people for ideas on how to handle this predicament. However, as it stand right now, a deep-learning model seems just as effective as a logistic regression model, and this comprability may indicate that the limits in model optimiziation given this dataset have been reached (without overfitting, of course). </p>
